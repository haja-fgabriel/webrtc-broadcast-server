# webrtc-smart-signaling
Signaling server made for broadcasting. It is the implementation of my B.Sc. thesis idea.

Prerequisites: 
1. Node.js version 14.16.1 (older versions may work too)

Installation:
1. Clone (or download) the repo wherever you want on your computer
2. ``npm install`` from the root folder of the cloned repo

Usage:
# TODO make variable port with an environment variable
- ``npm start`` - starts the server normally (on port 8000) 
- ``npm test`` - run all the tests
- ``npm run coverage`` - run all the tests and get a coverage log
